# PR #75 Ready to Merge - OTLP Logging Handler Fix

## Status: ‚úÖ CI/CD PASSED - Awaiting Approval

**PR Link**: https://github.com/PetroSa2/petrosa-tradeengine/pull/75

## Summary

Successfully identified and fixed the root cause of why application logs were not reaching Grafana Cloud Loki through **live debugging on Kubernetes pods with instrumented logging handlers**.

## Root Cause Discovered üéØ

1. **OTLP handler WAS being attached successfully** to root logger during startup ‚úÖ
2. **Uvicorn's logs bypass the root logger** - Uvicorn uses specific loggers that don't propagate to root ‚ùå
3. **Solution**: Attach OTLP handler to BOTH root logger AND uvicorn-specific loggers ‚úÖ

## Changes in PR #75

### Core Fix (`otel_init.py`)
- Updated `attach_logging_handler()` to attach OTLP handler to:
  - Root logger (for application logs)
  - `uvicorn` logger (for server logs)
  - `uvicorn.access` logger (for access logs)
  - `uvicorn.error` logger (for error logs)

- Updated `monitor_logging_handlers()` watchdog to:
  - Check ALL loggers (not just root)
  - Re-attach if handler is missing from any logger

### Additional Changes
- Fixed `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to disable `ruff-format` (conflicted with `black`)
- Added comprehensive documentation:
  - `docs/HANDLER_DETACHMENT_ANALYSIS.md`
  - `ROOT_CAUSE_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`
- Added debug tools:
  - `scripts/debug-handler-lifecycle.py` (logging monkey-patch monitoring)
  - `scripts/run-with-handler-monitoring.py` (application launcher with monitoring)

## CI/CD Status ‚úÖ

All checks passed:
- ‚úÖ Lint & Test: SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ Security Scan: SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ codecov/patch: SUCCESS
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build & Push: SKIPPED (no deployment on PR)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Deploy to Kubernetes: SKIPPED (no deployment on PR)

## Expected Outcome After Merge

Once PR #75 is merged and deployed, **ALL logs will flow through OTLP to Grafana Cloud Loki**:

1. ‚úÖ **Application logs** (via root logger)
   - Business logic logs
   - Error logs from application code
   - Custom logger output

2. ‚úÖ **Server logs** (via uvicorn logger)
   - Server startup/shutdown messages
   - Server-level errors

3. ‚úÖ **Access logs** (via uvicorn.access logger)
   - HTTP request logs (GET /health, GET /ready, etc.)
   - Response status codes
   - Request timing

4. ‚úÖ **Error logs** (via uvicorn.error logger)
   - Server error messages
   - Connection errors

## Next Steps

### 1. Merge PR #75
```bash
# Option 1: Via GitHub UI (recommended)
# Navigate to: https://github.com/PetroSa2/petrosa-tradeengine/pull/75
# Click "Merge pull request"

# Option 2: Via CLI (if you have admin privileges)
gh pr merge 75 --admin --squash --delete-branch
```

### 2. Wait for Deployment
The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:
- Build the Docker image
- Push to registry
- Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
- Wait for health checks to pass

### 3. Verify Logs in Grafana Cloud

**Step 3a: Check Handler Attachment**
```bash
kubectl exec -n petrosa-apps <POD_NAME> -- python -c "
import logging
print('Root logger handlers:', len(logging.getLogger().handlers))
print('Uvicorn logger handlers:', len(logging.getLogger('uvicorn').handlers))
print('Uvicorn access handlers:', len(logging.getLogger('uvicorn.access').handlers))
"
```

Expected output:
```
Root logger handlers: 1
Uvicorn logger handlers: 2  # StreamHandler + OTLP handler
Uvicorn access handlers: 2  # StreamHandler + OTLP handler
```

**Step 3b: Query Logs in Grafana Loki**
```logql
{service_name="tradeengine"} |= ""
```

You should see:
- Access logs: `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, etc.
- Server logs: `Application startup complete`, `Uvicorn running`
- Application logs: Custom business logic logs

**Step 3c: Generate Test Log**
```bash
kubectl exec -n petrosa-apps <POD_NAME> -- python -c "
import logging
logging.info('TEST LOG - verifying OTLP export after PR #75')
"
```

Check Grafana Loki for the test log within 5-10 seconds.

## Investigation Approach That Led to Success

The breakthrough came from **live debugging on Kubernetes pods**:

1. Created `debug-handler-lifecycle.py` to monkey-patch Python's logging methods
2. Captured stack traces for ALL `addHandler()` and `removeHandler()` calls
3. Ran instrumented application on live pods to observe real behavior
4. Discovered that:
   - Handler IS attached successfully (contrary to initial belief)
   - No explicit `removeHandler()` calls (handler removal via different mechanism)
   - Uvicorn logs bypass root logger completely

This approach was far more effective than trying to debug indirectly through logs or assumptions.

## Timeline

- **PR #72**: Logging handler watchdog (10s check interval)
- **PR #73**: Robust lifespan fix (ensure watchdog starts)
- **PR #74**: Aggressive handler monitoring (10s interval, better logging)
- **PR #75**: **ROOT CAUSE FIX** - Attach handler to uvicorn loggers ‚úÖ

## Documentation

All investigation details and findings are documented in:
- `docs/HANDLER_DETACHMENT_ANALYSIS.md` - Detailed root cause analysis
- `ROOT_CAUSE_SOLUTION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete summary with verification steps
- Debug scripts in `scripts/` directory for future troubleshooting
