# SL/TP Fix Implementation - Complete

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED AND VERIFIED**

---

## Summary

Successfully identified, fixed, and verified the issue preventing stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) orders from appearing on Binance Futures positions.

---

## What Was Done

### Phase 1: Investigation ‚úÖ

**Created diagnostic test script**: `scripts/test_sl_tp_hedge_mode.py`
- Tested 4 different strategies for placing SL/TP orders
- Identified that `reduceOnly=True` parameter causes error -1106 in hedge mode
- Confirmed Binance automatically handles reduceOnly when positionSide is set

**Key Finding**:
```
ERROR: APIError(code=-1106): Parameter 'reduceonly' sent when not required.
```

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis ‚úÖ

Identified **TWO issues**:

1. **Invalid reduceOnly parameter in hedge mode**
   - Binance rejects explicit `reduceOnly=True` when `positionSide` is specified
   - Binance automatically determines reduceOnly based on side + positionSide

2. **Incorrect status checking**
   - SL/TP orders return status `"NEW"` not `"filled"` or `"pending"`
   - Dispatcher was incorrectly logging successful orders as failed

### Phase 3: Implementation ‚úÖ

**Modified 2 files:**

1. **`tradeengine/exchange/binance.py`** (6 methods updated)
   - Conditional reduceOnly handling based on hedge mode
   - Only set reduceOnly when positionSide is NOT specified

2. **`tradeengine/dispatcher.py`** (2 methods updated)
   - Added `"NEW"` to success status list
   - Improved error logging with status information

### Phase 4: Verification ‚úÖ

**Created verification script**: `scripts/verify_sl_tp_fix.py`

**Test Results on Binance TESTNET:**
```
‚úÖ Stop Loss placed: Order ID 6062245179, Status: NEW
‚úÖ Take Profit placed: Order ID 6062245392, Status: NEW
‚úÖ Found 1 SL orders and 1 TP orders
‚úÖ SUCCESS: SL and TP orders were placed and verified on Binance!
```

## The Fix in Detail

### Before (Broken)
```python
# binance.py - Line 357
if order.reduce_only:
    params["reduceOnly"] = True  # ‚ùå Causes error -1106 in hedge mode

# dispatcher.py - Line 785
if sl_result.get("status") in ["filled", "partially_filled", "pending"]:
    # ‚ùå Never matches for SL/TP orders (they return "NEW")
```

### After (Working)
```python
# binance.py - Lines 352-360
if order.position_side:
    params["positionSide"] = order.position_side
    # In hedge mode, Binance automatically handles reduceOnly
else:
    if order.reduce_only:
        params["reduceOnly"] = True  # ‚úÖ Only in one-way mode

# dispatcher.py - Line 787
if sl_result.get("status") in ["filled", "partially_filled", "pending", "NEW"]:
    # ‚úÖ Correctly recognizes SL/TP placement
```

## Test Evidence

### Test A: Original Approach (FAILED)
```
‚ùå Binance API error: APIError(code=-1106): Parameter 'reduceonly' sent when not required.
```

### Test C: Without reduceOnly (SUCCESS)
```
‚úÖ Stop loss response: {
  "orderId": 6061951993,
  "status": "NEW",
  "type": "STOP_MARKET",
  "reduceOnly": true,  ‚Üê Binance sets this automatically!
  "side": "SELL",
  "positionSide": "LONG",
  "stopPrice": "106180.60"
}
```

### Final Verification (SUCCESS)
```
2025-10-16 19:11:36,773 - INFO - Found 1 SL orders and 1 TP orders
2025-10-16 19:11:36,773 - INFO - Order 6062245392: TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET SELL 0.001 @ stop=$110534.30 (positionSide=LONG)
2025-10-16 19:11:36,773 - INFO - Order 6062245179: STOP_MARKET SELL 0.001 @ stop=$106199.70 (positionSide=LONG)
```

## Current Deployment Status

### Code Status
- ‚úÖ Fixed code verified working on Binance TESTNET
- ‚úÖ Hot-patched to running pods for testing
- ‚úÖ Local Docker image built
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs**: Push to container registry for proper K8s deployment

### Running Pods
```
petrosa-tradeengine-ffb4cd6cf-6xvvh   1/1   Running   0   40m (with hot-patched fix)
petrosa-tradeengine-ffb4cd6cf-9bd7q   1/1   Running   0   37m
petrosa-tradeengine-ffb4cd6cf-qpd25   1/1   Running   0   38m
```

## Next Steps for Production

### 1. Container Registry Setup
```bash
# Option A: Use existing registry
docker tag petrosa-tradeengine:latest <registry>/petrosa-tradeengine:<version>
docker push <registry>/petrosa-tradeengine:<version>

# Option B: Set up local registry accessible to K8s cluster
# (depends on infrastructure setup)
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Update image tag in k8s/deployment.yaml
# Then apply
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

# Monitor rollout
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml rollout status deployment/petrosa-tradeengine -n petrosa-apps
```

### 3. Verify in Production
```bash
# Watch for SL/TP placement logs
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml logs -f -n petrosa-apps -l app=petrosa-tradeengine | grep "STOP LOSS\|TAKE PROFIT"

# Or run verification script
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml exec -n petrosa-apps deployment/petrosa-tradeengine -- python scripts/verify_sl_tp_fix.py
```

‚úÖ TAKE PROFIT PLACED: BTCUSDT | Order ID: 12346 | Take Profit Price: 52500.0 | Status: NEW
```

### Failure Indicators
Watch for these error patterns:
```
‚ùå STOP LOSS FAILED: BTCUSDT | Status: ... | Error: ...
