## 🎯 What Was Deployed

### PR #72 - Logging Handler Watchdog ✅
**Merged and Deployed**: 17:37 UTC

**What it does**:
- Background task runs every 30 seconds
- Checks if OTLP logging handler is attached
- Re-attaches if missing
- Self-healing mechanism for logs

**Code added to** `tradeengine/api.py`:
```python
async def logging_handler_watchdog() -> None:
    """Periodically ensure OTLP logging handler stays attached"""
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(30)
        was_attached = otel_init.ensure_logging_handler()
        if not was_attached:
            logger.warning("OTLP logging handler was removed, re-attached by watchdog")
```

## 📊 Expected Status (All Three Signals)

| Signal | Expected | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Metrics** | ✅ Working | Unaffected by logs changes |
| **Traces** | ✅ Working | Unaffected by logs changes |
| **Logs** | ✅ Should work | Watchdog keeps handler attached |

---

## ✅ When Cluster is Accessible - Run This

### Quick Check Script

```bash
cd /Users/yurisa2/petrosa/petrosa-tradeengine

# Get pod
POD=$(kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml get pods -n petrosa-apps -l app=petrosa-tradeengine -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')

echo "Pod: $POD"
echo ""

echo "=== Watchdog Status ==="
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml logs -n petrosa-apps $POD | grep -E "watchdog started|re-attached by watchdog"

echo ""
echo "=== Handler Status ==="
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml exec -n petrosa-apps $POD -- python -c "
import logging
print(f'Handlers: {len(logging.getLogger().handlers)}')
"

echo ""
echo "=== Send Test Traffic ==="
kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml exec -n petrosa-apps $POD -- wget -q -O- http://localhost:8000/health > /dev/null
echo "Health check sent"

echo ""
echo "Wait 30 seconds then check Grafana Cloud:"
echo "  URL: https://yurisa2.grafana.net"
echo "  Loki query: {namespace=\"petrosa-apps\", pod=~\"petrosa-tradeengine.*\"}"
```

## 🔍 Verification in Grafana Cloud

### URL: https://yurisa2.grafana.net

### 1. Verify Metrics ✅
**Navigate**: Explore → Prometheus

**Query**:
```promql
up{namespace="petrosa-apps", pod=~"petrosa-tradeengine.*"}
```

**Expected**: Metrics showing

### 2. Verify Traces ✅
**Navigate**: Explore → Tempo

**Query**:
```traceql
{service.name="tradeengine"}
```

**Expected**: Traces showing

### 3. Verify Logs ✅ (THE CRITICAL ONE)
**Navigate**: Explore → Loki

**Query**:
```logql
{namespace="petrosa-apps", pod=~"petrosa-tradeengine.*"}
```

**Expected - CONTINUOUS logs**:
- Startup logs (MongoDB, Binance initialization)
- Watchdog started message
- Health check logs (repeated)
- Trading activity
- **Logs continuing to flow, not just startup!**

**Key test**: Logs should appear BEYOND just initialization

---

## 🎊 Success Criteria

### Logs Working Means:
✅ Handler attached at startup
✅ Watchdog started
✅ Handler stays attached (checked every 30s)
✅ Logs visible in Grafana Cloud Loki
✅ Logs **continue** flowing (not just startup)

### All Three Signals:
✅ **Metrics**: Working
✅ **Traces**: Working
✅ **Logs**: Working continuously

---

## 🔧 If Logs Still Not Appearing

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Check watchdog is running**:
```bash
kubectl logs -n petrosa-apps $POD | grep "watchdog started"
```

2. **Check if watchdog is re-attaching** (sign handler keeps getting removed):
```bash
kubectl logs -n petrosa-apps $POD | grep "re-attached by watchdog"
```

3. **Manually verify handler works**:
```bash
kubectl exec -n petrosa-apps $POD -- python << 'EOF'
import otel_init
import logging
import time

otel_init.ensure_logging_handler()
logger = logging.getLogger("final_test")
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
logger.info(f"FINAL TEST LOG - {time.time()}")
time.sleep(15)
print("Check Grafana Loki for 'FINAL TEST LOG'")
EOF
```
