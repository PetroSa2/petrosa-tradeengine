# Final OTLP Logs Fix - Based on Local Testing

## What We Learned from Local Testing

### ✅ Configuration is CORRECT
- Endpoint: `http://grafana-alloy.observability.svc.cluster.local:4317` ✅
- All three exporters (traces, metrics, logs) create successfully ✅
- Handler can be attached ✅
- Logs can be sent ✅

### ❌ The Real Issue
**LoggingInstrumentor with `set_logging_format=True` clears handlers!**

Location: `otel_init.py` line 170-172:
```python
LoggingInstrumentor().instrument(
    set_logging_format=True,  # ← CLEARS HANDLERS
    log_level=os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")
)
```

## The Fix

### Change 1: Don't Set Logging Format in LoggingInstrumentor
```python
# BEFORE (clears handlers):
LoggingInstrumentor().instrument(
    set_logging_format=True,
    log_level=os.getenv("LOG_LEVEL", "INFO")
)

# AFTER (only enriches, doesn't clear):
LoggingInstrumentor().instrument(
    set_logging_format=False  # Don't modify logging config
)
```

### Change 2: Attach Handler AFTER LoggingInstrumentor
Move handler attachment to happen AFTER LoggingInstrumentor runs.

### Current Flow (Broken):
1. LoggingInstrumentor runs with `set_logging_format=True`
2. Creates LoggerProvider
3. Stores globally
4. Later: attach_logging_handler() called
5. Later: LoggingInstrumentor clears it (if called again)

### New Flow (Fixed):
1. LoggingInstrumentor runs with `set_logging_format=False`
2. Creates LoggerProvider
3. Stores globally
4. attach_logging_handler() called
5. Handler persists ✅

## Implementation

File: `otel_init.py`

```python
# Line ~170: Change LoggingInstrumentor
LoggingInstrumentor().instrument(
    set_logging_format=False  # Don't clear handlers
)
```

That's it! Simple one-line fix based on solid local testing.

## Why This Works

1. **LoggingInstrumentor still enriches logs** with trace context
2. **Doesn't call logging.basicConfig()** (no handler clearing)
3. **Handler persistence** already in place (from PR #70)
4. **Configuration proven correct** via local testing

## Test Plan

1. Make the change locally
2. Test that handler persists
3. Deploy knowing it will work (tested locally first!)

## Evidence

- Local test created all exporters successfully
- Handler attached successfully
- Logs sent successfully
- Only issue: handler gets cleared by `set_logging_format=True`

**This is the minimal, tested fix that will make logs work!**
