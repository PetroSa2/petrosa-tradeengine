# Trade Execution Business Metrics

## Overview

This document describes the custom business metrics added to the tradeengine for monitoring order execution, risk management, and trading performance. These metrics provide real-time observability into critical trading operations.

## Metrics Categories

### 1. Order Execution Metrics

#### `tradeengine_orders_executed_by_type_total`
- **Type**: Counter
- **Description**: Total number of orders executed, broken down by order type, side, symbol, and exchange
- **Labels**:

  - `side`: Order side (buy/sell)
  - `symbol`: Trading symbol (e.g., BTCUSDT)
  - `exchange`: Exchange identifier (binance)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Monitor order execution rate by type
  - Detect anomalies in order patterns
  - Calculate order distribution across symbols

**Example Query**:
```promql
# Order execution rate in the last 5 minutes
rate(tradeengine_orders_executed_by_type_total[5m])

# Total orders by type in the last hour
sum by (order_type) (increase(tradeengine_orders_executed_by_type_total[1h]))
```

#### `tradeengine_order_execution_latency_seconds`
- **Type**: Histogram
- **Description**: Time from signal receipt to order execution completion (in seconds)
- **Labels**:

## Integration with Existing Systems

### OpenTelemetry

All metrics are automatically exported to Grafana Cloud via OTLP when `OTEL_ENABLED=true`. The OTLP exporter endpoint is configured in the `petrosa-common-config` ConfigMap.

### Prometheus

Metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint and scraped by Prometheus every 15 seconds (configurable).

**Scrape Configuration**:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'tradeengine'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
        namespaces:
          names:
            - petrosa-apps
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        regex: petrosa-tradeengine
        action: keep
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_name]
        regex: metrics
        action: keep
```

## Testing

Comprehensive tests for all business metrics are available in `tests/test_business_metrics.py`.

**Run Tests**:
```bash
# Run all metric tests
pytest tests/test_business_metrics.py -v

# Run specific test class
pytest tests/test_business_metrics.py::TestOrderExecutionMetrics -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/test_business_metrics.py --cov=tradeengine.metrics --cov-report=html
```

## Best Practices

### Metric Naming
- All metrics use the `tradeengine_` prefix
- Business metrics use descriptive names (e.g., `order_execution_latency_seconds`)
- Metrics follow Prometheus naming conventions

### Label Cardinality
- Keep label cardinality low to avoid performance issues
- Symbol labels are limited to actively traded symbols
- Failure reasons are truncated to 50 characters

### Retention
- Metrics are retained according to Prometheus/Grafana Cloud retention policies
- Consider aggregating historical data for long-term analysis

### Performance Impact
- Metrics emission adds minimal overhead (<1ms per operation)
- Gauges are updated in-memory and synced periodically
- Histograms use pre-defined buckets for efficient storage

## Troubleshooting

### Metrics Not Appearing
1. Check that Prometheus is scraping the `/metrics` endpoint
2. Verify OTEL is enabled: `kubectl get configmap petrosa-common-config`
3. Check pod logs for metric emission: `kubectl logs -l app=petrosa-tradeengine`

### Incorrect Values
1. Verify position manager is updating correctly
2. Check for race conditions in distributed locks
3. Review risk management check logic

### High Cardinality
1. Limit the number of symbols being traded
2. Truncate failure reasons to reasonable length
3. Use label matchers in queries to reduce cardinality

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to business metrics:

1. **Order Book Depth Metrics**: Track order book liquidity and spread
2. **Slippage Metrics**: Measure execution price vs expected price
3. **Commission Tracking**: Monitor trading fees and costs
4. **Strategy Performance**: Per-strategy success rates and PnL
5. **Market Impact**: Measure price impact of large orders
