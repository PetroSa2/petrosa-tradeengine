# URGENT: Reverted Breaking Changes

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Issue**: PR #69 broke metrics and traces
**Fix**: PR #70 (MERGED) reverts the breaking change
**Status**: Deploying fix now

---

## ❌ What Broke

**PR #69 introduced**:
1. Stripping `http://` prefix from OTLP endpoint
2. Handler persistence logic

**Result**:
- ✅ Handler persistence: Good, still needed
- ❌ Endpoint stripping: **BROKE EVERYTHING**
  - Metrics stopped working
  - Traces stopped working
  - Logs briefly appeared then stopped

---

## 🔍 Why It Broke

**My Incorrect Assumption**:
- Thought gRPC OTLP exporters don't accept `http://` prefix
- Applied stripping to ALL exporters uniformly

**Reality**:
- Metrics and traces WERE working with `http://` prefix
- The Python gRPC OTLP libraries **DO handle the prefix correctly**
- Stripping it broke the working configuration

**Root Cause**:
- I fixed something that wasn't broken
- Broke working metrics/traces while trying to fix logs

---

## ✅ What I Did to Fix It

### PR #70 - MERGED AND DEPLOYING ✅

**Reverted**:
- Removed endpoint prefix stripping code
- ConfigMap restored to: `http://grafana-alloy...:4317`

**Kept**:
- Handler persistence logic (still valuable)
- `ensure_logging_handler()` function
- Global handler reference tracking

**Changes**:
```diff
- # Strip http:// prefix (REMOVED - was breaking things)
  otlp_endpoint = os.getenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT")
+ # No stripping - use endpoint as-is
```

## 📊 Current Status

### Code
- ✅ PR #70 merged
- 🔄 CI/CD building and deploying
- ⏳ ETA: ~10-15 minutes

### ConfigMap
- ✅ Reverted in git (petrosa_k8s)
- ⏳ Pending cluster access to apply
- Will restore `http://` prefix

### Expected Result
- ✅ Metrics will come back
- ✅ Traces will come back
- ❓ Logs still TBD (original issue remains)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Don't fix what's not broken**
   - Metrics and traces were working
   - Should have only changed logs-specific code

2. **Test thoroughly before merging**
   - Should have verified metrics/traces still worked
   - Broke production observability

3. **Incremental changes**
   - Should have done two separate PRs:
     1. Handler persistence only
     2. Investigate logs separately

4. **The actual logs issue is still unknown**
   - Stripping `http://` was NOT the fix
   - Need different approach for logs

---

## 🔧 Next Steps for Logs

**What We Still Know**:
1. Handler gets removed after startup (confirmed)
2. Handler persistence logic helps (now deployed)
3. Logs appeared briefly (user reported)

**What We DON'T Know**:
1. Why logs export fails even with correct handler
2. Whether OTLP log exporter config is correct
3. If there's a different issue with logs vs metrics/traces

**Proper Investigation Needed**:
1. Let metrics/traces restore first (PR #70 deploying)
2. Then investigate logs in isolation
3. Don't change working configuration
4. Test changes before deploying

## ⏰ Timeline

| Time | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| ~14:23 | PR #69 merged | ✅ |
| ~14:50 | User reports everything broken | ❌ |
| ~14:56 | PR #70 created (revert) | ✅ |
| ~14:58 | PR #70 merged | ✅ |
| ~15:00 | ConfigMap reverted in git | ✅ |
| ~15:10 | Expected: metrics/traces restored | ⏳ |

---

## 🚨 Immediate Actions

1. **Wait for PR #70 deployment** (~10-15 min)
2. **Verify metrics and traces come back**
3. **Apply ConfigMap to cluster** (when accessible)
4. **Monitor recovery**

---

## 📝 Apology & Path Forward

**I'm sorry for breaking metrics and traces.**

**What I should have done**:
- Only changed handler persistence
- Left endpoint configuration alone
- Investigated logs separately

**What I'm doing now**:
- ✅ Reverted breaking changes immediately
- ✅ Keeping valuable handler persistence logic
- ⏳ Deploying fix ASAP
- 📋 Will investigate logs properly without breaking working features

**Metrics and traces should be restored within 15 minutes.**

## 🎯 Correct Approach for Logs (Future)

1. Start with handler persistence (now deployed ✅)
2. Test if logs export with persistence alone
3. If not, investigate OTLP log exporter configuration
4. Check if logs need different export protocol
5. Test each change in isolation
6. **Never touch working metrics/traces configuration**

**Fix is deploying. Metrics and traces will be restored shortly.** 🔧
