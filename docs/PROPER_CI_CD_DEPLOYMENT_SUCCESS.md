## 🔧 **ISSUES RESOLVED DURING CI/CD**

### **1. Mypy Type Checking Errors**
**Problem**: Initial PR failed CI/CD due to mypy type errors
- Missing required fields in `TradeOrder` instantiation
- Incorrect argument types for OCO manager calls
- Wrong parameter names for position manager methods

**Solution**: Fixed all type errors in commit `f6ebf30`:
- ✅ Added all required fields to `TradeOrder` objects
- ✅ Fixed type coercion for optional parameters
- ✅ Corrected method parameter names
- ✅ Added null checks for exchange object

**Result**: ✅ CI/CD pipeline passed on second run

### **2. Immutable Job Spec Error**
**Problem**: Deployment failed due to immutable Job spec
- `petrosa-tradeengine-mysql-schema` job couldn't be updated

**Solution**: Deleted existing job to allow recreation
```bash
kubectl delete job petrosa-tradeengine-mysql-schema -n petrosa-apps
```

**Result**: ✅ New job created successfully
