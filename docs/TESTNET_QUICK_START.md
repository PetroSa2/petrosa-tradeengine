# Testnet OCO Validation - Quick Start

## 🚀 **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**

### **Step 1: Get Testnet API Keys** (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://testnet.binancefuture.com/
2. Login or register
3. Click on API Management
4. Create new API key
5. Save your API Key and Secret
6. Get free testnet USDT from the faucet

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables** (1 minute)

```bash
export BINANCE_API_KEY="your-testnet-api-key-here"
export BINANCE_API_SECRET="your-testnet-api-secret-here"
```

### **Step 3: Run Validation** (2 minutes)

```bash
./scripts/validate_oco_testnet.sh
```

That's it! The script will:
- ✅ Test Binance connection
- ✅ Place OCO orders on testnet
- ✅ Verify orders on Binance
- ✅ Test monitoring system
- ✅ Test cancellation
- ✅ Clean up

## 🔍 **Verify on Binance UI**

### **During the test, check Binance:**

1. Go to https://testnet.binancefuture.com/
2. Navigate to **Futures** → **Open Orders**
3. You should see **2 orders**:
   - STOP_MARKET (your SL)
   - TAKE_PROFIT_MARKET (your TP)

### **After the test:**

- Both orders should be **cancelled**
- No orphaned orders remaining
- Position closed

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Your OCO implementation is working if you see:

- ✅ Both SL and TP orders placed
- ✅ Orders visible on Binance
- ✅ Monitoring system active
- ✅ Orders cancelled successfully
- ✅ Cleanup completed

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: API Connection Failed**

```bash
❌ API connection failed: Invalid API key
```

**Solution:**
- Verify keys are from **testnet.binancefuture.com** (not mainnet)
- Check API permissions include Futures trading
- Ensure you copied the full key and secret

### **Problem: Insufficient Balance**

```bash
❌ Error: Insufficient balance
```

**Solution:**
- Go to testnet.binancefuture.com
- Use the faucet to get free testnet USDT
- Wait a few minutes for balance to update

### **Problem: Position Mode Error**

```bash
❌ Error: Invalid position side
```

**Solution:**
Enable hedge mode on your testnet account:
- Go to Account Settings
- Enable "Hedge Mode"
- Or run: `python scripts/verify_hedge_mode.py`

---

## 📝 **Alternative: Manual Step-by-Step**

If the automated script doesn't work, run manually:

```bash
# Step 1: Test connection
python scripts/test-binance-futures-testnet.py

# Step 2: Run OCO test
python scripts/live_oco_test.py

# Step 3: Check positions
python scripts/query_binance_positions.py
```

## 🎯 **What This Validates**

| Test | What It Checks | Expected Result |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Connection | Binance API access | ✅ Connected |
| Order Placement | Create SL + TP orders | ✅ Both created |
| Order Verification | Orders exist on Binance | ✅ Both visible |
| OCO Tracking | System tracks OCO pair | ✅ Tracked |
| Monitoring | Background task running | ✅ Active |
| Cancellation | Can cancel both orders | ✅ Both cancelled |
| Cleanup | OCO pair removed | ✅ Cleaned up |

---

## 🚀 **After Successful Validation**

Once testnet validation passes:

1. ✅ **Save the logs** - Keep evidence of successful test
2. ✅ **Test triggering** - Let one order fill naturally
3. ✅ **Verify OCO behavior** - Check other order cancels
4. 🔜 **Small live test** - Very small position on mainnet
5. 🔜 **Full deployment** - Deploy to production

---

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Cost**: Free (testnet only)

**Ready? Let's validate! 🚀**

```bash
./scripts/validate_oco_testnet.sh
```
