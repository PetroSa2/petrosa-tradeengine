# Trade Engine Bug Fixes - October 16, 2025

## Summary
Fixed multiple critical bugs affecting OCO orders, position tracking, datetime parsing, and MySQL persistence.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. OCO Orders Receiving 0.0 Amount ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** Stop loss and take profit orders were being created with 0.0 amount, causing "Order amount must be positive" errors.

**Root Cause:** Market orders return `amount: 0` in the result when status is "NEW" (order placed but not yet filled). The OCO manager was using `result.get("amount")` which returned 0.

**Fix:**
- Added fallback logic in `dispatcher.py` to use `order.amount` when `result.get("amount")` is 0 or None
- Applied to:
  - `_place_risk_management_orders()` (line 1056-1059)
  - `_place_stop_loss_order()` (line 1127-1130)
  - `_place_take_profit_order()` (line 1218-1221)

**Files Modified:**
- `tradeengine/dispatcher.py`

### 2. String-Float Type Error in Fill Price ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** `unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'float'` - fill_price was returned as string "0.00" instead of float.

**Root Cause:** Binance API can return numeric values as strings, and arithmetic operations fail when mixing string and float types.

**Fix:**
- Added type checking and conversion for `fill_price`, `amount`, and `commission` in position creation and updates
- Ensures all numeric values are converted to float before arithmetic operations

**Code Example:**
```python
# Ensure fill_price is a float, not a string
fill_price = result.get("fill_price", order.target_price or 0)
if isinstance(fill_price, str):
    fill_price = float(fill_price) if fill_price else (order.target_price or 0)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `tradeengine/position_manager.py` (lines 374-402, 277-285)

---

### 3. Invalid Datetime Parsing ('99') ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** `Invalid isoformat string: '99'` - NATS messages with invalid timestamp values caused parsing failures.

**Root Cause:** Signal timestamp validator was too strict and failed completely on invalid values, preventing the signal from being processed.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced timestamp validator to:
  - Validate Unix timestamp ranges (year 2000-2100)
  - Log warnings for invalid timestamps
  - Fallback to current time instead of raising errors
  - Gracefully handle edge cases

**Benefits:**
- Signals with invalid timestamps now process successfully with warnings
- System continues operating instead of crashing
- Better debugging with clear warning messages

**Files Modified:**
- `contracts/signal.py` (lines 186-238)

---

### 4. MySQL Retry Logic Missing ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** MySQL operations failed permanently on transient connection errors.

**Root Cause:** No retry logic for MySQL operations - single failures caused permanent data loss.

**Fix:**
- Added exponential backoff retry logic to critical MySQL operations:
  - `create_position()` - 3 retries with exponential backoff
  - `update_position_risk_orders()` - 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Configuration:
  - `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3`
  - `RETRY_DELAY = 1.0` seconds
  - `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2.0`

**Retry Schedule:**
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: After 1.0s
- Attempt 3: After 2.0s

**Files Modified:**
- `shared/mysql_client.py` (lines 108-193, 248-320)

---

### 5. Database Truth Value Testing Error ‚ùå ‚Üí ‚úÖ
**Issue:** `Database objects do not implement truth value testing or bool(). Please compare with None instead: database is not None`

**Root Cause:** SQLAlchemy database objects were being used in boolean context (`if self.mongodb_db:`) instead of explicit None comparison.

**Fix:**
- Changed all database object checks from `if self.mongodb_db:` to `if self.mongodb_db is not None:`
- Applied to 3 locations in position_manager.py

**Files Modified:**
- `tradeengine/position_manager.py` (lines 413, 459, 536)

---

## Test Results

‚úÖ All tests passing
‚úÖ No linter errors
‚úÖ Position tracking working correctly
‚úÖ OCO orders being placed with correct amounts
‚úÖ MySQL retry logic functioning
‚úÖ Invalid timestamps handled gracefully

## Deployment Notes

No breaking changes - these are all bug fixes that improve reliability:

1. **OCO orders** - Now use correct quantities from original orders
2. **Type safety** - All numeric values properly typed
3. **Timestamp handling** - Gracefully handles invalid timestamps
4. **MySQL resilience** - Automatic retry on transient errors
5. **Database checks** - Proper None comparisons for SQLAlchemy objects

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fix applied and tested
2. üîÑ Commit changes to feature branch
3. üîÑ Merge to main
4. üîÑ Deploy to production
5. Monitor logs for:
   - OCO order placement success
   - MySQL retry patterns
   - Invalid timestamp warnings
