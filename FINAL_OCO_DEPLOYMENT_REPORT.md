## 🔧 OCO IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### **1. OCOManager Class**
Located in: `tradeengine/dispatcher.py`

**Capabilities**:
- ✅ Place paired SL/TP orders
- ✅ Track active OCO pairs
- ✅ Monitor order status (polling-based)
- ✅ Automatically cancel other order when one fills
- ✅ Clean up OCO pairs on position close
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

**Key Methods**:
- `place_oco_orders()`: Places paired SL/TP orders
- `cancel_oco_pair()`: Cancels both orders for a position
- `cancel_other_order()`: Cancels remaining order after one fills
- `start_monitoring()`: Starts order monitoring task
- `stop_monitoring()`: Stops order monitoring task
- `_monitor_orders()`: Polls and checks order status

### **2. Dispatcher Integration**
Enhanced `Dispatcher` class with OCO functionality:

**New Features**:
- ✅ Automatic OCO order placement in `_place_risk_management_orders()`
- ✅ `close_position_with_cleanup()` method for proper position closure
- ✅ `shutdown()` method to stop OCO monitoring
- ✅ Fallback to individual orders if OCO fails

**Integration Points**:
```python
# OCO Manager initialized in Dispatcher.__init__
self.oco_manager = OCOManager(exchange, self.logger)

# Automatic OCO placement when both SL and TP specified
if order.stop_loss and order.take_profit:
    oco_result = await self.oco_manager.place_oco_orders(...)
```

### **3. Binance API Fixes**
Location: `tradeengine/exchange/binance.py`

**Problem Solved**: `APIError(code=-1106): Parameter 'reduceonly' sent when not required`

**Solution**:
- ✅ Removed `reduceOnly` parameter when `positionSide` is specified
- ✅ Binance automatically infers reduce-only behavior in hedge mode
- ✅ Only include `reduceOnly` in one-way mode

**Impact**: SL/TP orders now place successfully without API errors

## 🎉 CONCLUSION

The OCO implementation is now **LIVE IN PRODUCTION** with full functionality:

### **For Manual Position Closure**
When you close a position manually, the system will:
1. Cancel all associated OCO orders first
2. Close the position
3. Clean up all tracking records

### **For Automatic Position Closure**
When an SL or TP order executes:
1. The order monitoring detects the fill
2. Automatically cancels the other order
3. Updates position records accordingly

### **For New Positions**
When opening a position with both SL and TP:
1. Both orders are placed simultaneously
2. Tracked as an OCO pair
3. Monitored continuously
4. One fills → other cancels automatically
