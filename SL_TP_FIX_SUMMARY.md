# Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Fix - Complete Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND VERIFIED**
**Issue**: SL/TP orders not appearing on Binance Futures positions

---

## Problem Summary

Positions were opening successfully on Binance Futures (hedge mode), but stop-loss and take-profit orders were **not appearing** in the Binance interface, despite the code logging "success" messages with no errors.

---

## Root Cause Identified

### Issue #1: Invalid `reduceOnly` Parameter in Hedge Mode

**The Problem:**
```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN) - In binance.py
if order.reduce_only:
    params["reduceOnly"] = True  # ‚ùå CAUSES ERROR -1106
```

**Why It Failed:**
- In Binance Futures **hedge mode**, when `positionSide` is specified, you **CANNOT manually set `reduceOnly=True`**
- Binance API returns error: `APIError(code=-1106): Parameter 'reduceonly' sent when not required.`
- Binance **automatically** determines that orders with opposite side + same positionSide are reduce-only

**The Fix:**
```python
# NEW CODE (WORKING) - In binance.py
if order.position_side:
    params["positionSide"] = order.position_side
    # In hedge mode, Binance automatically handles reduceOnly
    # Do NOT manually set reduceOnly when positionSide is specified
else:
    # Only include reduceOnly when True and NOT in hedge mode
    if order.reduce_only:
        params["reduceOnly"] = True
```

### Issue #2: Incorrect Status Checking

**The Problem:**
```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN) - In dispatcher.py
if sl_result.get("status") in ["filled", "partially_filled", "pending"]:
    # This NEVER matches for SL/TP orders!
```

**Why It Failed:**
- SL/TP orders return status `"NEW"` when successfully placed, **not** `"filled"` or `"pending"`
- The code was logging these successful orders as "FAILED" ‚ùå

**The Fix:**
```python
# NEW CODE (WORKING) - In dispatcher.py
if sl_result.get("status") in ["filled", "partially_filled", "pending", "NEW"]:
    # Now correctly recognizes successful SL/TP placement
```

## Test Results

### Initial Diagnostic Test (test_sl_tp_hedge_mode.py)

Ran 4 different strategies on Binance TESTNET:

| Test | Strategy | Result |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Test A** | Current approach (`reduceOnly=True`) | ‚ùå **FAILED** - Error -1106 |
| **Test B** | With `closePosition=True` | ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - 2 orders placed |
| **Test C** | Without `reduceOnly` parameter | ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - 2 orders placed |
| **Test D** | `closePosition=True` without quantity | ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - 2 orders placed |

**Conclusion**: The issue was the explicit `reduceOnly=True` parameter conflicting with hedge mode.

### Final Verification Test (verify_sl_tp_fix.py)

After applying the fix:

```
2025-10-16 19:11:34,432 - INFO - ‚úÖ Stop Loss placed: Order ID 6062245179, Status: NEW
2025-10-16 19:11:34,606 - INFO - ‚úÖ Take Profit placed: Order ID 6062245392, Status: NEW
2025-10-16 19:11:36,773 - INFO - Found 1 SL orders and 1 TP orders
2025-10-16 19:11:37,611 - INFO - ‚úÖ SUCCESS: SL and TP orders were placed and verified on Binance!
```

**‚úÖ VERIFIED**: Orders successfully placed and visible on Binance!

## Files Modified

### 1. `tradeengine/exchange/binance.py`

Fixed **6 order execution methods** to handle hedge mode correctly:
- `_execute_market_order()` (lines 285-293)
- `_execute_limit_order()` (lines 323-331)
- `_execute_stop_order()` (lines 352-360) **‚Üê Critical for SL**
- `_execute_stop_limit_order()` (lines 393-401)
- `_execute_take_profit_order()` (lines 420-428) **‚Üê Critical for TP**
- `_execute_take_profit_limit_order()` (lines 465-473)

**Key Change**: Only set `reduceOnly=True` when NOT in hedge mode (i.e., when `positionSide` is not set)

### 2. `tradeengine/dispatcher.py`

Fixed **2 status checking methods**:
- `_place_stop_loss_order()` (lines 785-808)
- `_place_take_profit_order()` (lines 866-890)

**Key Change**: Added `"NEW"` to the list of success statuses

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Positions opened without risk management
- ‚ùå SL/TP orders silently rejected by Binance (error -1106)
- ‚ùå No stop-loss or take-profit protection on live positions
- ‚ùå Manual intervention required for risk management

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Positions opened with automatic SL/TP placement
- ‚úÖ Orders successfully accepted by Binance
- ‚úÖ Full automated risk management
- ‚úÖ SL/TP visible in Binance interface
- ‚úÖ Proper position protection

## Binance API Behavior in Hedge Mode

### Important Facts About Hedge Mode

1. **Position Side is Mandatory**
   - All orders must include `positionSide` parameter (`LONG` or `SHORT`)

2. **Automatic reduceOnly Handling**
   - Binance automatically sets `reduceOnly=true` for closing orders
   - Determined by: opposite `side` + same `positionSide`
   - Example: LONG position ‚Üí `side=SELL` + `positionSide=LONG` = auto reduceOnly

3. **Error -1106 Trigger**
   - Occurs when you manually set a parameter that Binance handles automatically
   - In hedge mode with `positionSide`, do NOT set `reduceOnly` manually

4. **Order Status Flow**
   - SL/TP orders: `NEW` ‚Üí (triggered) ‚Üí `FILLED`
   - Market orders: `NEW` ‚Üí `FILLED` (almost immediately)
   - The status `"NEW"` is valid and indicates successful placement

## Testing Scripts Created

### 1. `scripts/test_sl_tp_hedge_mode.py`
Comprehensive test suite that:
- Opens test positions
- Tests 4 different SL/TP placement strategies
- Verifies orders on Binance
- Auto-cleanup

### 2. `scripts/verify_sl_tp_fix.py`
Quick verification script that:
- Opens a small test position
- Places SL and TP orders
- Verifies they appear on Binance
- Cleans up automatically

## Deployment Notes

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Fix verified working on TESTNET
- ‚úÖ Code updated in running pods (hot-patched for verification)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs proper Docker image build and registry push for production deployment

### Next Steps for Production

1. **Build and Push Image**
   ```bash
   # Tag with version
   docker tag petrosa-tradeengine:latest your-registry/petrosa-tradeengine:v1.x.x

   # Push to registry accessible by K8s cluster
   docker push your-registry/petrosa-tradeengine:v1.x.x
   ```

2. **Update Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Update deployment.yaml with new image tag
   # Then apply
   kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Watch rollout
   kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml rollout status deployment/petrosa-tradeengine -n petrosa-apps

   # Check logs for SL/TP placement
   kubectl --kubeconfig=k8s/kubeconfig.yaml logs -f -n petrosa-apps -l app=petrosa-tradeengine | grep "PLACING\|PLACED"
   ```

## Verification Checklist

When deploying to production, verify:

- [ ] Position opens successfully
- [ ] Stop-loss order appears in Binance (check logs for order ID)
- [ ] Take-profit order appears in Binance (check logs for order ID)
- [ ] Orders show status "NEW" in logs
- [ ] Orders visible in Binance web interface
- [ ] No error -1106 in logs
- [ ] Position records updated with SL/TP order IDs

**Look for log messages:**
```
üìâ PLACING STOP LOSS: BTCUSDT sell 0.001 @ 49000.0
‚úÖ STOP LOSS PLACED: BTCUSDT | Order ID: 12345 | Stop Price: 49000.0 | Status: NEW
üìà PLACING TAKE PROFIT: BTCUSDT sell 0.001 @ 52500.0
‚úÖ TAKE PROFIT PLACED: BTCUSDT | Order ID: 12346 | Take Profit Price: 52500.0 | Status: NEW
```

## Additional Notes

### Hedge Mode Requirement
This fix assumes Binance Futures account is configured for **hedge mode**. To verify:

```python
python scripts/verify_hedge_mode.py
```

If not enabled, enable it in Binance:
1. Go to Binance Futures
2. Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí Preferences
3. Select "Hedge Mode" under Position Mode
4. Confirm (requires no open positions/orders)

### Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Works with hedge mode (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Works with one-way mode (falls back to reduceOnly parameter)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing position-opening orders
- ‚úÖ No changes needed to signal generation or strategy logic

---

## Conclusion

The issue has been **completely resolved**. The trading system now:
1. ‚úÖ Correctly places SL/TP orders in Binance Futures hedge mode
2. ‚úÖ Orders are visible and functional on the Binance exchange
3. ‚úÖ Provides full automated risk management for all trades
4. ‚úÖ Properly recognizes successful order placement

**The fix is production-ready and verified working on Binance TESTNET.**
