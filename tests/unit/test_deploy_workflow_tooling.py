"""Regression tests for the post-petrosa_k8s#1110 GitOps deployment checkout.

petrosa_k8s#1110 moved agent tooling (including scripts/gitops-rebase-main.sh)
out of the petrosa_k8s repository and into the umbrella repository
(PetroSa2/petrosa). Every service's `deploy.yml`/`manual-deploy.yml` GitOps job
checks out a nested `petrosa_k8s` working copy and invokes
`./scripts/gitops-rebase-main.sh` from it -- after #1110 that script no longer
exists there, so every GitOps push failed with
`./scripts/gitops-rebase-main.sh: No such file or directory` (exit 127),
silently stopping fixed images from ever reaching the cluster (see cio#232,
mirroring the same regression already root-caused for
petrosa-data-manager#338/#339).

These tests assert both workflow files check out the umbrella repository and
symlink its `scripts/` into the `petrosa_k8s` checkout *before* invoking the
rebase script, so this failure mode cannot silently return.
